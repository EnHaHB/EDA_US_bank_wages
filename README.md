# EDA_project_all

This project is centered around exploratory data 
analysis techniques and modeling data using linear regression 
using a data set with wages in US banks.

## Objectives

* Conduct an exploratory data analysis of the data set 
and provide at least 3 insights for a stakeholder. 
In my case an applicant interested in the US banking business.

* Predict the salary as accurate as possible by implementing
a multivariate linear regression model.

## Deliverables

* A well documented Jupyter notebook.
* A Python script for training the model, printing out the model statistics and saving the model.
* An organized README.md file (How did I do?)
* A short presentation of the key findings.

## Infos

I've used Python 3.8.5, all the needed libraries 
can be found in the requirements file.

This is how you may start:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
